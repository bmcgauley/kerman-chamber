## Top Performers (Design Benchmarks)

### 🥇 Fresno Chamber — fresnochamber.com

- Upcoming Events section immediately after hero
- Social: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn

### 🥈 Coalinga Chamber — coalingachamber.com
**Why they win:** Modern Streamline platform, event-image-forward design
**Key design patterns:**

## What Our KCC Site Does *Better*

1. **Stats bar** — no competitor shows "75 Years · 200 Members · 20 Events" in a floating bar. This is attention-grabbing and trust-building.
2. **Design quality** — Fresno is the only modernish site; Madera and Reedley look 2014. KCC's navy/gold/warm-white premium aesthetic stands out significantly.
3. **Config-driven** — no competitor's site can be cloned and redeployed in minutes. This is our secret weapon.

## Design Directives for Lead-Specific Sites

When cloning the template for each lead, adjust:
1. **Hero headline** — match city's identity (e.g., "Where Reedley Business Grows" → "Where Your City Business Grows")
2. **Signature event** — swap Garlic Festival for their most known annual event
3. **Stats bar** — use real Google review count, years established
4. **Color accent** — slight tweak to accent hex if city has a known brand color
